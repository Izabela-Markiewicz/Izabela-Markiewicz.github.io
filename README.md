This is a project hosted from my GitHub account using a domain created on NameSpace. It is accessible from any browser on any device - try it! 

Why isn't the full project hosted?:
- GitHub Pages works easily with static page, however Django webapps are too dynamic.
- GDAL libraries (working with geospatial data) required for my project are not straightforward to replicate by the hosting services - additonal build packs are required whcih causes major issues
- Hosting services use their own database: Fear of data loss from my local database with an export
- Time constraints
